# ✅ Post Card Style Update - Complete

## 🎨 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Post Card Redesign
Updated `PostCard` component to match blog card style exactly:

**Style Features:**
- ✅ Glass effect with border (`glass border border-white/20`)
- ✅ Rounded corners (`rounded-beagle-lg`)
- ✅ Shadow effects (`shadow-beagle-md hover:shadow-beagle-lg`)
- ✅ Hover lift effect (`hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all`)
- ✅ Same font sizes as blog card (text-sm, text-xs)
- ✅ Same button style (`Button variant="ghost" size="sm"`)
- ✅ Same header layout with avatar, username, date, delete button
- ✅ Badge showing "Post" type
- ✅ Border-top separator for actions (`border-t`)

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header (Avatar, Name, Date, Delete) │
│ Badge: "Post"                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Main Image (aspect-video)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Content Text (with @mentions)       │
│ Additional Images (up to 3 + more)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Like | Comment    Views (author only)│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. ✅ Views Display Logic
- Views only visible to post author
- Shows eye icon + count
- Located on right side of action bar
- Styled as: `text-xs text-gray-500`

### 3. ✅ Profile Page Updates

**Updated Both Profile Pages:**
- `/profile` - Current user profile
- `/profile/[userId]` - Other user profiles

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches both blogs AND posts
- ✅ Combines them into single array
- ✅ Sorts by `createdAt` descending (newest first)
- ✅ Renders appropriate card:
  - `BlogCardHorizontal` for blogs
  - `PostCard` for posts (wrapped in border div)
- ✅ Shows "No posts yet" when empty
- ✅ Loading spinner while fetching

### 4. ✅ Blog List Page Updates

**Filter System:**
- "All" tab - shows both blogs and posts
- "Blogs" tab - shows only blogs
- "Posts" tab - shows only posts

**Rendering:**
- Combined content sorted by date
- Different cards for different types
- Maintains masonry layout (columns-1 md:columns-2 lg:columns-3)

|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Container | glass border rounded | ✅ Same |
| Shadow | shadow-beagle-md/lg | ✅ Same |
| Header Layout | Avatar + Name + Date | ✅ Same |

3. Post shows views only to author

## 🔍 Key Features

### @Mention Highlighting
```tsx
const renderContentWithMentions = (text: string) => {
  const parts = text.split(/(@\w+)/g)
  return parts.map((part, i) => {
    if (part.startsWith('@')) {
      return <span className="text-accent hover:underline cursor-pointer">{part}</span>
    }
    return part
  })
}
```

### Views Display (Author Only)
```tsx
{isAuthor && (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-1 text-xs text-gray-500">
    <Eye className="h-3 w-3" />
    <span>{post.views}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### Content Sorting (Newest First)
```tsx
[...blogs.map(b => ({ ...b, itemType: 'blog' })), 
 ...posts.map(p => ({ ...p, itemType: 'post' }))]
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime())
```
